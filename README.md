In principle you only need to install Botorch ( For more info refer to https://botorch.org/) through

pip install botorch

in *python 3.8.0*

Otherwise, you could also match all my dependencies by installing my environment conda:

conda env create --file=environment.yaml

Conda is a great way to organize your environments. I highly recommend to use it.

After installing your enviroment, make sure the repo recognizes all dependencies.
